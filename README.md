Thanks for your interest to participate in our Interview Prep course! Sadly, we received your email past the deadline for the admission and we can only accept a maximum of *30* students in each course and given that we receive hundreds of applications, all classes are full.

We very much appreciate your interest and hope to see you next summer where we will be running classes again! To **compensate** for your time, here is a link to a high-level software interview guide containing *tips* and *guidelines* that you might find helpful!

To learn more, here is our resources page. Feel free to *sign up* for our mailing list for your convenience! If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to *reply* to this email.

*Hope to see you next summer,*
